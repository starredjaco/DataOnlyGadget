# DataOnlyGadget
DOG is a post-exploitation toolkit that uses your existing kernel read/write primitives to locate, classify, and chain kernel gadgets, resolve the structures and offsets and build reusable chains at runtime to perform the attacks.

It uses [`NTKernelWalkerLib`](https://github.com/jsacco/NTKernelWalkerLib) to recover the offsets and structures needed during discovery.

## Summary

The tool is built around a pluggable kernel read/write backend and a runtime discovery pipeline. It resolves `ntoskrnl` symbols, walks kernel structures, generates offsets dynamically, enumerates kernel objects, collects gadget candidates, classify them, and organizes the discovered gadgets into chains.

## Supported Exploit Classes

DOG is written to sit on top of an existing kernel read/write primitive and handle the runtime work that comes after primitive acquisition.

The project is built for exploit paths that depend on:

- locating writable kernel data targets at runtime
- resolving the structures and offsets those targets depend on
- turning discovered entries into reusable chains

In practice, DOG is not tied to one specific primitive. The backend layer is abstracted behind `KernelReadWrite`, so different exploit classes can be adapted to the same discovery and chaining pipeline as long as they expose the memory operations DOG needs.

The physical-memory backend included in this repository is just an example implementation, please plug-in your own.

## Using DOG With an Existing R/W Primitive

DOG is meant to be used after kernel read/write access already exists.

If you already have a working primitive, the expected workflow is to adapt it to DOG’s backend layer and let DOG handle the rest:

- resolving the kernel symbols, structures, and offsets required for the current build
- enumerating kernel objects and candidate gadget targets
- collecting and classifying the entries it finds
- building chains from the discovered targets

The discovery and chaining logic are separated from the transport layer so other primitives can be plugged in through `KernelReadWrite` and `RwFactory`.

## Example Workflows

A few practical ways DOG fits into an existing exploit:

- You already have kernel R/W, but you do not want to keep chasing offsets every time the target build changes. DOG handles the runtime structure and offset recovery first, then works from there.
- You already have a primitive, but you do not want to hand-audit kernel memory looking for usable targets. DOG walks the relevant objects and collects candidate entries automatically.
- You want to see what the current machine actually exposes before doing anything else. DOG gives you a live inventory of discovered gadget targets instead of relying on assumptions from another build.
- You want to separate primitive acquisition from target discovery. The primitive only needs to give DOG memory access; DOG handles symbol lookup, offset recovery, enumeration, discovery, and chain building on top.
- You want to compare what changes between builds or systems. DOG can export the discovered entries so you can diff results instead of repeating the same manual analysis each time.
- You already know the kind of target you are looking for, but you want the tool to narrow the search space and organize the usable entries for you.
